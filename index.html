					<p>The following is a set of ratings of existing global sub-national boundary data sets. Two things should be emphasized. (1) This is <em>pre-alpha</em>. We believe in collaborating in the open, but none of these ratings are currently backed up by proper methodology or research. (2) We recognize the incredibly hard work that many individuals have put into creating the below datasets, often in their spare time and working against the bear impossible odds of having to balance the individual requirements of dozens of national survey departments and governments. We are trying to support this entire ecosystem by showing how much room for growth there is in the entire sector, <em>not</em> disparage the work of any individual publisher - all of whom we admire greatly.</p>
